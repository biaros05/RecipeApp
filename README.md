# Recipes for College Students on a Budget
## Persona
Our persona is Chad, a 19 year old college student who cant write english essays. He has limited kitchen applicances and absolutely no time or skills devoted to cooking. He is also broke, and has 3 roomates who have basic cookig skills. However, with their schedules, they do not have time to cook any meals and have trouble finding recipes that can be done in a limited amount of time. This website will be targeted to people like Chad and his unfortunate roomates. So, on our website, we will dedicate a tab to quick recipes under 30 minutes, and each recipe will also include a difficulty rating.

## Agreements
What will you do to ensure your code is readable? For example, will you share your code frequently
with your partner? Setup Visual Studio Codeâ€™s auto formatter consistently across group members
We will add comments and documentation on our code. Descriptive variable names and implement helper methods to modularize and make our code readable.

What procedure will you put in place to ensure committed code is functional?
We will test our code before commiting and merging. We will also use feature branches, and when we know the code is functional, we will submit a merge request and have our partners verify the logistics of the code and approve the request.

How do you plan to test your code?
We will use the debugger, and and write unit tests as we write our methods. each method will thus include multiple tests for any cases we can think of, and we will run these tests.

How do you plan to divide the work?
We will split the features by weight evenly, and also assign the work based on someone's strengths and what they feel more comfortable writing and working on.

How will you ensure that your application is robust and does not fail due to user errors?
We will make sure unit tests cover all edge cases, and once the application is done, we will run and test it thouroughly. We will also make sure to handle any exceptions that may occur in the c# application layer.

How will you ensure your stand alone classes can be tested?
We will make sure each class has a specific functionality and serves a purpose, and that they have methods that perform a specific, useful task that return values or manipulate the object.

## Extra Features:
1. **including a difficulty rating for each of the recipes (as a rating system that the people who try the recipe can set)
2. We will implement the budget system
4. unit conversions between grams, liters, quantity
